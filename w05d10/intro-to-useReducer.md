# useReducer Hook

## Objectives

- Discuss the concept of a `reducer` in JavaScript
- Implement a basic example of a `reducer`
- Implement a basic example of the `useReducer` hook
- Explain when and where to use `useState` vs `useReducer`

## What is a reducer?

A `reducer` is a fancy word for a function that takes in several values and reduces them in someway.

In fact you may have already worked with a `reducer` it you have ever used the `Array.reduce()` method.

```js
Array.reduce((acc, val, index) => {
	return acc;
}, init);
```

The parameters that `reduce()` takes in are:

- a callback function that takes in an accumulator (acc), the current element in the loop (val), the index position of that element (index)
- an optional starting value (init), which can be a number, array, object, ect.

The `accumulator` will determine if it has been assigned a starting value otherwise it will use the element at the first position in the array.

### Working Through Some Examples

Let's work through a few examples of `Array.reduce()` so we are all up to speed on what the method is meant to do.

#### Sum An Array

How would you use `.reduce()` to return a single value that is the sum of all numbers in the following array?

```js
INPUT: [1, 2, 3];
OUTPUT: 6;
```

#### Counting Duplicates

Another use case for `.reduce()` would be to count duplicates. Say you had the following and wanted to count how many instances there were of each.

```js
INPUT: ['banana', 'cherry', 'orange', 'apple', 'cherry', 'orange', 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange', 'fig' ]
OUTPUT: { banana: 2, cherry: 3, orange: 3, apple: 2, fig: 1 }
```

In both cases we reduced the input of many things to a single thing, be it a number or agit pun object.

## Creating A Reducer

So now that we have worked through a few examples of `[].reduce()` let's apply this knowledge and create a `reducer`.

Fork the 
 [Starter CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/counter-class-to-functional-usestate-starter-jdj6f?file=/src/components/Counter.js)

<!-- BACKUP -->
<!-- [CodeSandbox - Counter Reducer - Starter](https://codesandbox.io/s/counter-usereducer-starter-luru8?file=/src/components/Counter.js) -->

So the concept of a `reducer` has been around for sometime in JavaScript long before the introduction of `Array.reduce`.

When applied to building an application it becomes a tool which we use to manage both the `state` of an application and the` business logic` as well.

So the `reducer` is essentially a function that does the followng:

**takes in the following params**

- current state
- the action to be performed on state

**returns**

- a new/updated version of state (old state is never mutated)

```js
(state, action) => returns a new version of state
```

This follows one of the rules we learned regarding state which is:

**:oncoming_police_car: Never update the state value directly**

Although we already have a working example of a `Counter` component, lets give the code a once over so were all on the same page.

Here is the state of the Counter.

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

Here are our supporting functions

```js
const handleIncrement = () => setCounter(count + 1);
const handleDecrement = () => setCounter(count - 1);
const handleReset = () => setCounter(0);
```

And of course the buttons that call the supporting functions.

```js
<section>
	<h2>Count:{count}</h2>
	<button onClick={handleIncrement}>+</button>
	<button onClick={handleDecrement}>-</button>
	<button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
</section>
```

### Our First Reducer

Let's refactor this a bit to use a `reducer` function. The idea here is to aggregate state and all the logic needed to update state into one single function.

It will take in the following:

- current state
- an action to perform that will update state

```sh
function counterReducer(state, action){
    if(action === 'INCREMENT') {
        return state + 1
    } else if (action === 'DECREMENT') {
        return state - 1
    } else if (action === 'RESET') {
        return 0
    }
    return state
}
```

One thing to note about the above code is that the `action` being passed is expected, by convention, to be uppercase. This convention is meant to highlight the action being performed and a convention that is expected when using `Redux`.

If the `action` doesn't match any condition, we default to return the unchanged state. It's very clear in the function that the `action` determines how state is to be updated.

#### Refactor Buttons

And of course the buttons need a bit of refactoring as well. Once again we are passing in the current state and the action to be performed.

```sh
<button onClick={() => setCount(counterReducer(count, 'INCREMENT'))}>+</button>
<button onClick={() => setCount(counterReducer(count, 'DECREMENT'))}>-</button>
<button onClick={() => setCount(counterReducer(count, 'RESET'))}>Reset</button>
```

### Switch Statements

For the sake of readability `switch` statements have become the defacto conditional logic for reducers.

So let's rewrite the above code as follows:

```sh
function counterReducer(state, action) {
    switch(action) {
        case 'INCREMENT': return state + 1
        case 'DECREMENT': return state - 1
        case 'RESET': return 0
        default: return state
    }
}
```

From the looks of it the switch statement does indeed make it easier to read.

#### :question: What are the benefits of managing the applications state using a `reducer` function?

## useReducer Hook

The two basic hooks that are used for state management in React are: `useState` and `useReducer`, with the addition of `useContext` for managing a more global form of state.

In order to work with the `useReducer` hook we need to first import it and, since it essentially replaces `useState` we can remove that.

```js
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';
```

`useReducer` works very similar to `useState` but with some differences. Like useState it returns a tuple `[state, setState]` with the first element in the array being `state` and the second a `set function`

It almost seems like the two are the same at this point. But there is a difference.

`useReducer` takes in a `callback` as the first argument and the initial `state value` as the second.

Another convention to follow is that the `setState` function is called `dispatch`. 
```sh
// const [count, dispatch] = useReducer( callback function, initial state)
const [count, dispatch] = useReducer((state, action) => { }, 0)
```

In order to better convey the `dispatch` naming convention let's take a look at the reducer in dev tools:

```js
console.log('Counter - useReducer(counterReducer, 0)', useReducer(counterReducer, 0))
```

We should see the following and take note of the fact that the target function is called `dispatchAction`.

#### Using the `counterReducer` Function
With `useReducer` in place we can now replace the callback with the `counterReducer` function that we created earlier

```js
const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, 0);
```

Now all that is left is to update are the buttons. Although `dispatch` is essentially the `counterReducer` function, which itself takes in two params: `state` and `action`, we only need to pass dispatch a single `action` value. 

This is because `useReducer` will be executing the callback function and it takes on the responsibility of managing and updating the current state based on the action provided. 

```sh
<button onClick={() => dispatch('INCREMENT')}>+</button>
<button onClick={() => dispatch('DECREMENT')}>-</button>
<button onClick={() => dispatch('RESET')}>Reset</button>
```

## Working With More Complex Actions

If choosing to go with `useReducer` there's a good chance your working with a more complex version of state object and/or which require more action values. 

### Action

The convention for writing an `Action` is to have both a `type` and a `payload`. While the type is the action to be performed, the payload is the value used to update state.

Our first refactor is to send an object as a payload which includes the `type` of action to perform and the `value` by which to update state.

```sh
<button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT', value: 1})}>+</button>
<button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'DECREMENT', value: 1})}>-</button>
<button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'RESET', value: 0})}>Reset</button>
```

Our second refactor is on counterReducer and here we update the code to reference either `action.type` or `action.value`.

```sh
function counterReducer(state, action) {
    switch(action.type) {
     case 'INCREMENT':
        return (state += action.value);
      case 'DECREMENT':
        return (state -= action.value);
      case 'RESET':
        return (state = action.value);
      default:
        return state;
    }
}
```

## Bonus Material

### Why useReducer over useState?

Whenever there are two things that seem do the same thing, people inevitably ask: "When do I use one over the other?" Since we have useState, why do we need useReducer at all?

The React team advises the following:

> useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks . — React Team

Also Kent C. Dodds wrote up a explanation (article linked in references) of the differences between the two and, while he often reaches for setState, he provides a good use case for using useReducer instead:

> If one element of your state relies on the value of another element of your state, then it’s almost always best to use useReducer

The example he works through in his article is a bit advanced but the gist of it is that he is implementing a state that includes a `past`, `present` and `future` and is a more complex version of state than we are used to working with.
