# Context

### Learning Objectives:

- Explain how we simply code using abstraction
- Understand what Providers and Consumers are and what they do
- Implement a shared context to avoid prop drilling


## Framing Context

A good analogy of Context vs Props is when we shop online.  Props is like buying a product from a retailer instead of the manufactures.  Doing so adds one more step and additional overhead/cost to the whole process.  However Context is like buying the product directly from the manufacturer.  

`useContext` is one of the `3 Basic Hooks` that included with [React v16.8](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html).  It provides a global form of state that child components can consume directly. It makes use of the `Provider/Consumer` model.

Let's take a few minutes to review the [useContext](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)  hook official documentation

**Note:** As mentioned when used with `useReducer` the two Hook create a low level version of [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), which is a state management tool for JavaScript applications and has become synonymous with React state management.

#### Where Does State Go?

As we've covered before, React has a unidirectional data flow, passing props from parents to children. Components that manage their own state will often pass this information down as props child components.

As our app grows, the `tree of components` grows with it. Soon the decision to create additional state may require that you pass pass and/or lift state further and farther in the React hierarchy.

How would you answer the following question:

<hr>
:question: **Where should you store and manage single or multiple instances of state in any of the apps you build?**

<hr>


There are a lot of ways to answer this question - ultimately, it comes down to your own understanding of the app, and your preferences as a developer. But, a generic way to answer this question would be: 

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

**Manage state in the Component or nearest "ancestor" of the components that need to make use of it**.

### App-level state

We discussed this briefly when we covered *lifting state* - when we had two sibling components that needed to share some state, we "lifted" the state up to the parent component.

But, there are times where pieces of state need to be used across the entire app. For instance:

 - When many views & UI components need to know who the currently logged-in user is.
 - When all UI components need to know if the app is in "light" or "dark" mode.


### Avoiding Prop Drilling

So far, we have been passing props down from parent to child components. In most instances, this is the easiest way to handle sharing information between parent and child components.

But, as your tree grows, you'll find yourself passing props down multiple levels. In the example below sending a single value of state all the way down to the the last child requires passing it down as props through every intermediary Component in the hierarchy.

#### Use useContent

A much better way would be to provide access to state at a global level and have the child Component access it directly.  This is where we would make use of the **useContext** hook.

### Summary: When & Why to use Context

So the two main reasons we should make use of useContext are: 

- Avoiding Prop Drilling
- Provide access to App-level state to components dispersed through the app hierarchy

## Context Provider and Consumer Model

When using Context, you'll be dealing with a *Provider* component and *Consumer* components.

*Providers* are components that exist higher up on the tree, sending - or _providing_ - information to other components that are further down. This component must wrap the parts of the tree that it will be communicating with.

*Consumers* are components that receive - or _consume_ - information from their Provider ancestor. Consumer components use the *function as a child* pattern to 'extract' these values so we can use them in our own components.

Lets take a look at [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/) in DevTools in order to see the `Provider/Consumer` model in action. 

And let's also take a look at [Dropbox](https://i.imgur.com/Nfd511p.png) and see an example of how context is used to pass a theme.

### React Router Provider > Consumer Example 

Another example of the Provider > Consumer model is `React Router`.  If you haven't already worked on the [iStocks App](https://vhixt.csb.app/) React router assignment then it's something we will get to in the next few lessons.  

For now just know that `React Router` uses the `Provider > Consumer` model which is visible in React DevTools.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Muw1Jxm.png" width="400">

Also another thing to note is that `React Router` creates and passes the following props using the `Provider > Consumer` model.

```js
this is Home - props 
{history: {…}, location: {…}, match: {…}, staticContext: undefined}
history: {length: 1, action: "POP", location: {…}, createHref: ƒ, push: ƒ, …}
location: {pathname: "/", search: "", hash: "", state: undefined}
match: {path: "/", url: "/", isExact: true, params: {…}}
```

## Instructor Demo Of Prop Drilling

The Instructor will perform a demo of using `prop drilling` to pass state from App to it's child Components.  

In this demo we will be using the following starter code: [React Context CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/usecontext-starter-dont-edit-4v65w?file=/src/components/App.js)

<!-- Here is the [Prop Drilling Solution Code](https://codesandbox.io/s/usecontext-solution-prop-drilling-wvfrc?file=/src/components/ComponentD.js) -->


## Working With React Context

<!-- In this demo we will be using the following starter code: [React Context CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/usecontext-starter-dont-edit-4v65w?file=/src/components/App.js) -->

Working with React Context involves setting up context in the parent Component and then consuming it in the child.  In order to work with context  we will need to do the following:

In the App Component:
- import `createContext` 
- create and export an instance of `createContext`
- set up a `context.Provider `
- provide the data via the `context.Provider`

In the Child Components:
- import the `useContext`
- import the `context` from App
- instantiate `useContext` to use the imported `context` from App


## App Component

### Importing and Using `createContext`

Before we can work with context we first need to import `createContext` from React. 

```js
import React, { createContext } from "react";
```

Now we instantiate and export a new instance `createContext`. 

```js
export const DataContext = createContext()
console.log('DataContent', DataContext)
```

This function returns an object with two properties, `Provider` and `Consumer`:

### Setting Up The Context Provider

The `Provider` is wrapped around the Components that we wish to provide the context.  It requires a single prop called `value` which is assigned the data we wish the child Components to consume. 

In this example we will pass the userData that has been imported and stored in state. 

```html
<DataContext.Provider value={userData}>
    <ComponentA />
    <ComponentE />
</DataContext.Provider>
```

## Child Components
The child Components will now consume the data.  Consumers must first import `useContext` and the Context provided from the parent Component.

```js
import React, { useContext } from "react";

import { DataContext } from './App'
```

**useContext**

Let's now setup `useContext` to use the context imported from App. 

```js
const dataContext = useContext(DataContext)
```

And now we can access that data.

```js
function ComponentD() {
  return (
    <div style={style}>
      This is Component D
      <div> 
        <div>username: {dataContext.name}</div>
            <img
            class="avatar-image"
            src={dataContext.img}
            alt="avatar"
          />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
