Let's build a react giphy app!

Here is a [working version of the Giphy App](https://pl515.csb.app/)

#### Your task is:
* Go to the Giphy docs [HERE](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/), _read_ them
* Create an account and get your Free API key.

* Diagram your App:
  * What components will you have?
  * Where would state "live"?
  * Where would you setup  `useEffect`?
  * Where do you need to pass props?
  * Where do you need to make the API call?

#### 🚀 Completion looks like:

* Minimum of 3 components.
* A single gif should rendered when the page initially loads (think ComponentDidMount)
* On Button click make another API call update state with the new Gif
* Render only a single gif at a time

#### Bonus - Add A Form

- Add a Form that allows the user to type in a search query for specific Giphy's

#### Bonus - Favorite A Giphy

- Allow the user to favorite a Giphy and toggle between the Random Giphy and their Favorite List
