# Shopping Cart

So far you've learned the following about React:

- Creating and nesting Components
- Passing props and how to using them in JSX
- Importing and setting up state
- Updating state and re-rendering the Component
- Adding and calling event listeners
- Capturing user input

Now it's time to put it all together. 

## Working Version
Here is a [working version](https://cmix9.csb.app/) of the app so you have a reference of the base functionality that you are being asked to implement. 

## Starter CodeSandbox
<!-- Here is our [Starter CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-shopping-cart-solution-1prws?file=/src/App.js) -->
Here is the [Starter CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-shopping-cart-starter-e2km4)

## Instructions
For this exercise you will do the following:

#### App Component
- Examine the working live solution and look over the HTML elements
- Will pass down functions to the corresponding Components in order to life those values back into App in order to update state. 
- Update state to include the value which will then update the UI to show that item

#### Form Component

- Create a new Form Component that provides the user the following inputs:
  - product name
  - price
  - submit button
- The inputs will be `controlled` and only when the user submits will the values be captured
- The Component will pass the data captured to it's parent (App)

#### AllTheThings Component

- Render a full list of the products with name and price
- When an item is clicked the value will be lifted to App
- App will update state and place the item 

#### MyShoppingCart Component

- Render the list of products in your shopping cart
- When an item is clicked the index of that item in the array will be lifted to App
- App will remove the item from the array based on its index and update state
